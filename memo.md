# terraform memo

[Get Started - AWS](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started)やったときのメモ

## まずはつかってみる

tfファイルを作ってawscliをインストール
設定ファイルを作成
```
MacBook-Pro-2:terraform vaivailx$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: *************
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ********************
Default region name [None]: ap-northeast-1
Default output format [None]: json
MacBook-Pro-2:getstarted vaivailx$ ls ~/.aws/
config          credentials
MacBook-Pro-2:getstarted vaivailx$ ll
-rw-r--r--  1 vaivailx  staff  172  6 28 19:11 example.tf
```

terraform init実行して初期化
```
MacBook-Pro-2:getstarted vaivailx$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (terraform-providers/aws) 2.17.0...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.aws: version = "~> 2.17"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.example: Creating...

Error: Error launching source instance: OptInRequired: You are not subscribed to this service. Please go to http://aws.amazon.com to subscribe.
        status code: 401, request id: 89c96d86-9a91-41c6-b78e-d14091ac8fe2

  on example.tf line 6, in resource "aws_instance" "example":
   6: resource "aws_instance" "example" {
```

401なので権限不足。EC2のAmazonEC2FullAccessというポリシーを追加して再度実行する。
あと、連絡先登録とか、登録後のSMS確認やらできていなかった。
で、再度実施。
```
MacBook-Pro-2:getstarted vaivailx$ terraform apply
...
Error: Error launching source instance: InvalidAMIID.NotFound: The image id '[ami-0c3fd0f5d33134a76]' does not exist
        status code: 400, request id: 8101b7d7-a9fb-4d59-8c66-9006598d3be1

  on example.tf line 6, in resource "aws_instance" "example":
   6: resource "aws_instance" "example" {
...
```

そんなAMI IDはないと言われる。
→ami idは東京リージョンのものをみて変えて、リージョンは変更していなかったからだ。
まずはEC2コンソールで使えることを確認してからやろうとしたので中途半端にAMI IDだけ変えていた。

そんなわけでリージョン修正して再実行。
```

## 設定変更をする

https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/change

設定変更とその反映をお試し

ami を以下のように変更した
```
//  ami           = "ami-0c3fd0f5d33134a76"
  ami           = "ami-1d37b57b"
```

terraform applyで適用

```

MacBook-Pro-2:getstarted vaivailx$

ami を変えるので、
>  aws_instance.example must be replaced
とでている。
その上でyesとして実行すると、
> Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
とされて、既存のは壊して、新しいの作ったよってなる。

ただEC2コンソールを見ると、既存のものは停止されて、新しいインスタンスが作られている。
消すわけではないようだ。

planだと消すらしい。ためしてみよう。

//  ami           = "ami-0c3fd0f5d33134a76"
  ami           = "ami-1d37b57b"

  を
  逆にする

  ami           = "ami-0c3fd0f5d33134a76"
  // ami           = "ami-1d37b57b"

コンソール上ではEC2はとまっていた。
が、どんどんインスタンスができる。
これは運用時に面倒だ。
なんとかする方法があるはず。

再度確認したら、コンソール上では何もなくなっていた。
削除までには時間がかかるみたい。

### 依存関係の定義

```
## New resource for the S3 bucket our application will use.
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  ## NOTE: S3 bucket names must be unique across _all_ AWS accounts, so
  ## this name must be changed before applying this example to avoid naming
  ## conflicts.
  bucket = "terraform-getting-started-guide"
  acl    = "private"
}

## Change the aws_instance we declared earlier to now include "depends_on"
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-2757f631"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ## Tells Terraform that this EC2 instance must be created only after the
  ## S3 bucket has been created.
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}
```

https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/dependencies#non-dependent-resources
によると、明示的にdepends_onを指定しなければ依存しない。


## プロビジョニングについて

https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/provision

### provision

```
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${aws_instance.example.public_ip} > ip_address.txt"
  }
```
といれると、プロビジョニングもしてくれる

今回のprovisionerはterraformを実行する側で実行するもの。
```
The local-exec provisioner executes a command locally on the machine running Terraform.
```

```
Terraform supports multiple provisioners,
```
とある。chefやpuppetでのプロビジョニングや、fileの転送ができるよう。
ansibleが無いのは、local-execでansible呼び出せばできてしまうからかな？
→これはちがった。後述の記事でlocal-execが実行されるタイミングではsshできないからできない（1年前の記事だけど）
それは先人たちが苦労したり、ツールを使っているみたい。
terraform -> ansibleで構築 https://qiita.com/k1LoW/items/d3ff2fedc8c354b7db67
ツールを使ってterraform->toolかませてansible http://blog.serverworks.co.jp/tech/2018/03/07/post-63012/
ansibleの中でterraformを実行 https://blog.engineer.adways.net/entry/2016/11/11/174438

ざっと見た感じansibleからterraformを実行するのが良さそうだが、
そうでない方式をとっている人が多いので、やるとしたらよく検討しないといけないな。
理想はvagrantのvagrant upのように、terraform applyワンコマンドで必要なサーバーができている状態だけど。
いやでも、家畜のようにインスタンスを作ったり捨てたりするならば、プロビジョニングした
amiがあってそれをもとにterraformでセットアップが適切かもな。

話がとんだので、チュートリアルのプロビジョニングをお試し。
```
aws_instance.example (local-exec): Executing: ["/bin/sh" "-c" "echo 13.230.171.100 > ip_address.txt"]
aws_instance.example: Creation complete after 39s [id=i-0326e014c10dd8abf]
aws_eip.ip: Creating...
aws_eip.ip: Creation complete after 2s [id=eipalloc-05019d40771294ef8]

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
MacBook-Pro-2:getstarted vaivailx$ cat ip_address.txt
13.230.171.100
MacBook-Pro-2:getstarted vaivailx$
```
実行されて、ファイルも生成されている。


さっきansibleでどうこうとか書いたけど、チュートリアルに以下のように書いていた。
```
Provisioners are only run when a resource is created. They are not a replacement for configuration management and changing the software of an already-running server, and are instead just meant as a way to bootstrap a server.For configuration management, you should use Terraform provisioning to invoke a real configuration management solution.
 ```
その後に書いているね。
provisionersはあくまでブートストラップ用に使うこと。
terraformとは設定管理に対するソリューションとして使うものですよ。
と。
だからprovisionerはそこまで複雑なことはできない（terraformのポリシーを考えると、できるようにする必要はないということかな）


ちなみにチュートリアルに書いてあるとおり、provisioningはインスタンス生成時にしか実行されない。
ipかえて適用しても、destroyしてもファイルは生成されない。

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.example: Destroying... [id=i-056e7b486beaa7273]
aws_instance.example: Still destroying... [id=i-056e7b486beaa7273, 10s elapsed]
aws_instance.example: Still destroying... [id=i-056e7b486beaa7273, 20s elapsed]
aws_instance.example: Still destroying... [id=i-056e7b486beaa7273, 30s elapsed]
aws_instance.example: Destruction complete after 37s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.

### provisionに失敗したリソースの扱い

https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/provision#failed-provisioners-and-tainted-resources

にあるように、プロビジョニングに失敗したらtainted（汚れている）とterraformは状態を記録する。taintedのリソースにterraform applyすると、対象のリソースは一度壊されて、再生成される。
terraformのポリシーとしてplan実行時に出される期待される変更状態にならなければ、ぶっ壊してでも再生成するらしい。

### destroy時のprovisoin
destroy時のprovisoiningも設定できるとのこと。

https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/provision#destroy-provisioners

## 変数定義

変数定義方法は3種類

1. \*.tfファイルかterraform.tfvarsか\*.auto.tfvarsに定義して、var.hogeで参照する
2. \*.tfファイルかterraform.tfvarsか\*.auto.tfvarsに変数名のみ定義して、コマンド実行時に入力
3. 別にファイルに定義して、実行時に-var-fileオプションで指定
4. 環境変数TF_VAR_hogeとか設定してterraformコマンドを実行
5. -varオプションを実行時に指定

1はファイルがあるだけで展開されてしまうので、秘匿情報は定義すべきではない。
4は文字列しか定義できないし、これもコマンド履歴に残る可能性があるので秘匿情報は定義すべきではない
秘匿情報は2か3の方法かな
https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/variables


変数はいくつか型があり、List, Map。
Listなら
```
cidrs = [ "10.0.0.0/16", "10.1.0.0/16" ]
```

Map
```
variable "amis" {
  type = "map"
  default = {
    "us-east-1" = "ami-b374d5a5"
    "us-west-2" = "ami-4b32be2b"
  }
}
```

実行時に変数を出力するときoutputを定義する

```
output "ami" {
  value = aws_instance.example.ami
}
```

## 本番環境ではどうつかうか？

https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/remote
ローカルやテスト環境づくりにはいいけど、複数人で同じインフラ管理をする場合、
stateファイルはローカルにしかないため、複数人で状態管理しづらい。
→本番でも使えるようにstateファイルを管理できるようにTerraform Cloudというサービスがある。
アカウントを作って定義ファイルでbackendを定義すれば、OK
不要な変更適用はされない。


## 次のステップ

もっと学びたいなら以下をやること

Documentation https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html
Operations and Development Tracks https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/#operations-and-development  アクセス権設定をするための方法とか
example https://www.terraform.io/intro/examples/index.html
import https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html 既存のリソースからstateをとれるらしい。→それなら絶対にbackendを使わなきゃいけないってではなさそうな。。

## 所感

いちいちAWSコンソールを立ち上げなくとも設定変更をかけられるのがよい。
たとえばプロダクション環境と同じ構成だけど台数は制限してステージング環境を立てて、開発環境はSPOTで立てられるようにしておくと利点はあるかな。
どのAMI使う？設定の違いは？構成変更はどこで保存してどう適応する？とか気にする部分は少なくなる。
これ以上はなんかサービスでも作らないと恩恵がわかりにくいな。


## 追記 しばらくたってからもう一度terraformを使おうとする

### aws cliが使えるか確認

前提となっているaws cliが使用できる状態7日`aws configure`でaws cli確認する

```zsh
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted % aws configure
zsh: /usr/local/bin/aws: bad interpreter: /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.7: no such file or directory
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted %
```

今のPATHに通っているPythonのバージョンを調べる。

```zsh
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted % python --version
Python 3.8.1
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted %
```

今デフォルトは3.8で当時とバージョンが違うから入れ直したほうがいいと判断。

[公式サイト](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/cli/)を参照して最新版のパッケージをインストールした。

で、再度`aws configure`

```zsh
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted % aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [****************XXXX]:
AWS Secret Access Key [****************XXXX]:
Default region name [ap-northeast-1]:
Default output format [json]:
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted %
```

XXXXとなっているところは、もともと設定していた値が表示されていた。
（怖がりなのでマスクしています）


###　terraform update

[aws get started](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/aws-get-started)に沿ってアップデートしていく。

```zsh
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted % brew upgrade hashicorp/tap/terraform
Updating Homebrew...
==> Auto-updated Homebrew!

...

Error: hashicorp/tap/terraform not installed
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted %
```

terraform がない！？
思い出した以前はdockernizedのterraform使っていたのだった。
まあせっかくだからインストールをしておこう。

```zsh
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted % brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
==> Installing terraform from hashicorp/tap
==> Downloading https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraf
...

🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/terraform/0.15.4: 3 files, 77.4MB, built in 25 seconds
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted % terraform -version
Terraform v0.15.4
on darwin_amd64
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted %
```

入った！

### Enable tab completion

ドキュメントをみると、bashであろうと、zshであろうとホームディレクトリにrcファイルがあればコマンドは同じだった。以下を実行する。

```zsh
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted % terraform -install-autocomplete
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted % terraform -install-autocomplete
Error executing CLI: 2 errors occurred:
        * already installed in /Users/vaivailx/.bashrc
        * already installed in /Users/vaivailx/.zshrc


vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted %
```

はじめて実行したときは、何も出力されなかったので、不安に思って再実行したらもうインストールしているよとでた。
実際補完も効いた。

### Quick　start tutorial

> Now that you've installed Terraform, you can provision an NGINX server in less than a minute using Docker on Mac, Windows, or Linux.

1分もかけずにnginxをプロビジョンするのをチュートリアルとしてやるらしい。
わくわく。（前回terraformさわったときはget startedやらずに実践Terraformだけさわっていたようだ。まったく記憶にないもの。）

書かれているとおりに

```zsh
mkdir terraform-docker-demo && cd $_
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 getstarted % mkdir terraform-docker-demo && cd $_
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 terraform-docker-demo % vi main.tf
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 terraform-docker-demo % terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of kreuzwerker/docker...
- Installing kreuzwerker/docker v2.11.0...
- Installed kreuzwerker/docker v2.11.0 (self-signed, key ID 24E54F214569A8A5)

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 terraform-docker-demo %

```

providerとしてdockerのものが入ったと。

ちなみに、main.tf

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source = "kreuzwerker/docker"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx:latest"
  keep_locally = false
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.latest
  name  = "tutorial"
  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 8000
  }
}
```

```zsh
terraform apply
```

とちゅう`yes`って入力して待っていたらできましたね。

```zsh
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 terraform-docker-demo % docker ps | grep 8000
70cdfbf72fb4   f0b8a9a54136              "/docker-entrypoint.…"   48 seconds ago      Up 44 seconds      0.0.0.0:8000->80/tcp                                                                       tutorial
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 terraform-docker-demo %
```

ブラウザでもwelcomeページがでたよ。

そして後始末。

```zsh
vaivailx@MacBook-Pro-2 terraform-docker-demo % terraform destroy

...

docker_image.nginx: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
```

いいね。

業務だと、ローカルでいろんなリポジトリからファイルとってきて、各リポジトリのコンテナの立ち上げてってのはめんどうだからterraformでやっちゃうほうが
docker composeより楽かも。
